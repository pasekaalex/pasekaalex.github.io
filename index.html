			I generated the word frequency using a HashMap in Java. I made this for my Data Structures class in Brooklyn College.

			<br>
			I used the Kumo Library to construct a word cloud in the shape of a stairway for the lyrics of Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. I used the .jar version of the Kumo Library to import it to Eclipse and used the library's functions to create the image.

			There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
			And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
			When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>
			With a word she can get what she came for.<br>
			Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
			<br>
			There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure<br>
			'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>
			In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,<br>
			Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.<br>
			<br>
			Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br>
			Ooh, it makes me wonder.<br>
			<br>
			There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br>
			And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>
			In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br>
			And the voices of those who stand looking.<br>
			<br>
			Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br>
			Ooh, it really makes me wonder.<br>
			<br>
			And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,<br>
			Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br>
			And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,<br>
			And the forests will echo with laughter.<br>
			<br>
			If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,<br>
			It's just a spring clean for the May queen.<br>
			Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
			There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>
			And it makes me wonder.<br>
			<br>
			Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,<br>
			The piper's calling you to join him,<br>
			Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>
			Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br>
			<br>
			And as we wind on down the road<br>
			Our shadows taller than our soul.<br>
			There walks a lady we all know<br>
			Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
			How everything still turns to gold.<br>
			And if you listen very hard<br>
			The tune will come to you at last.<br>
			When all are one and one is all<br>
			To be a rock and not to roll.<br>
			<br>
			And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
